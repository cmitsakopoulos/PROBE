# PROBE
PROBE: Platform for Research On Bacterial Effectors. A lightweight CLI Python application that automates  bacterial effectors presence surveys and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
PROBE makes use of multiple Python libraries and a small array of freely available bioinformatics software. To fully take advantage of PROBE’s capabilities, it is recommended that the user install all the following software:

•	QUAST version: v5.2.0 and above; (Optional)
•	BLAST version: v2.15.0 and above; (Required)
•	MAFFT version: v7.52.0; and above (Optional)
•	RAxML version:  v 8.2.12 and above; (Optional)
•	Pandas version: v 2.2; Future PROBE updates will allow for newer version of Pandas to be installed (Required)
•	Seaborn version: v0.13.2 and above; (Required)
•	ETE Toolkit v3.0.0b34 and above; (Optional)
•	Click version: v8.1.7; and above (Required)
•	Reportlab version: v4.1.0 and above; (Required)
•	Matplotlib version: v3.8.3 and above; (Required)
•	Python version: v3.11.5 and above; (Required) 

However, since PROBE’s architecture is self-contained, the user could opt to use only the required-(Required) software and run PROBE’s automatic BLAST calculation functions; note that in this case, Functions 3 and 4 will be unviable due to missing pre-requisites.
